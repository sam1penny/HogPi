Changes to the HogPi codebase in the refactor

1. Only post data if each script runs
2. Posts all videos in a directory, this allows internet outages to not be fatal, and only deletes videos once they have been sent
3. Added timeouts to most processes, so the script can continue if they crash, this also works with the new post system
4. RFID now uses SD2 instead of RAT because this allows for the use of serial.Serial.read_until which simplifies rfid.py significantly
5. Moved file cleanup to hedge.py
6. Now flipping video horizontally (Dad's insistance!) so video files are correct
